        <p class="justified">
            Here at Enterprise Portfolio Management we understand the struggles that can occur when managing a large
            portfolio of properties. The company founder spent several years in employment with a blue chip organisation,
            acting as a Property Administrator looking after a portfolio of 60+ properties before returning to education
            and founding this organisation.
        </p>

        <p class="justified">
            During his time in employment he often became frustrated with the number of electronic documents that were
            kept and often could not find the information that was required easily. With the nightmares still fresh
            within his mind he set out to create an online resource in which portfolio information could be stored,
            accessed virtually anywhere and the key details easily located, and thus began Enterprise Portfolio
            Management.
        </p>

        <p class="justified">
            The Enterprise Portfolio Management system will continue to grow, further functionality will be added and
            our customers opinions will also be listened to. We hope that we can create an all encompassing online
            application that can be used by any organisation no matter the size and cater for their every need.
